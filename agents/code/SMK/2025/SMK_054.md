**Date:** 1. november 2025
**Agent:** Code (Resonanskammer-Implement√∏r)
**Type:** Security Infrastructure + API Key Management
**Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** - Both keys stored securely
**Related:** Supabase integration, Secret Manager setup, Windows Credential Manager

---

## üéØ Executive Summary

Complete secure storage infrastructure for Supabase API keys (Service Role Key + Anon Key) in both Google Secret Manager (production) and Windows Credential Manager (local development). Scripts refactored from interactive input to environment variable-based for reliability.

**Key Achievements:**
1. ‚úÖ Supabase Service Role Key stored in Secret Manager + Windows Credential Manager
2. ‚úÖ Supabase Anon Key stored in Secret Manager + Windows Credential Manager
3. ‚úÖ All PowerShell scripts refactored to use environment variables (no more Read-Host locking)
4. ‚úÖ Fixed array handling for gcloud output in PowerShell
5. ‚úÖ Complete key rotation documentation and scripts

**Security:** Service Role Key has FULL database access (bypasses RLS). Stored securely, never exposed in frontend.

**Infrastructure:**
- Google Secret Manager: `supabase-service-role-key`, `supabase-anon-key`
- Windows Credential Manager: `SupabaseAPI:service-role-key`, `SupabaseAPI:anon-key`
- Project: `dotted-stage-476513-r4`

## üìö Learning Points

### LP #143: PowerShell Script Locking - Read-Host Interruptions

**Problem:** PowerShell scripts using `Read-Host -AsSecureString` were locking/freezing in non-interactive contexts (Cursor terminal, background execution).

**Root Cause:** `Read-Host` requires interactive console input. When run from IDE or automated contexts, it blocks indefinitely waiting for user input that never comes.

**Solution Pattern:**
```powershell
# ‚ùå OLD (interactive, locks)
$secureKey = Read-Host "Enter key" -AsSecureString
$key = [Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::PtrToStringAuto(...)

# ‚úÖ NEW (environment variable, reliable)
$key = $env:SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
if ([string]::IsNullOrWhiteSpace($key)) {
    Write-Host "Set environment variable first:" -ForegroundColor Cyan
    Write-Host "  `$env:SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY = 'eyJ...'" -ForegroundColor Gray
    exit 1
}
```

**Meta-Insight:** When tools break in automation, it's often because they assume human presence. Environment variables are the universal interface between human intent and automated systems.

**Application:** Always prefer environment variables over interactive prompts for scripts that might run in automation.

### LP #144: gcloud PowerShell Output Array Handling

**Problem:** `gcloud secrets versions access` returns array in PowerShell, not string. Scripts trying to use `.Trim()` or `.Substring()` failed with type errors.

**Root Cause:** PowerShell's `2>&1` redirect combines stdout/stderr into array when multiple output streams exist.

**Solution Pattern:**
```powershell
$output = gcloud secrets versions access latest --secret=supabase-key --project=$PROJECT_ID 2>&1

# Handle array output
if ($output -is [array]) {
    $key = $output -join "`n"
} else {
    $key = $output.ToString()
}

# Always trim whitespace
$key = $key.Trim()
```

**Meta-Insight:** PowerShell's type system is fluid - what looks like a string might be an array. Type-check before methods, handle both cases gracefully.

**Application:** Always type-check gcloud output before string operations. Use `-is [array]` guard clause.

---

### LP #145: Dual-Layer API Key Storage Strategy

**Pattern:** Store sensitive keys in BOTH Secret Manager (production/CI) AND Windows Credential Manager (local development).

**Why:**
- Secret Manager: Accessible from anywhere (CI/CD, cloud functions, remote servers)
- Windows Credential Manager: Fast local access, no network dependency, Windows-native
- Both: Redundancy, different access patterns, different threat models

**Implementation:**
- Google Secret Manager: `gcloud secrets create/versions add`
- Windows Credential Manager: `cmdkey /generic:Target:name /user:user /pass:password`
- Retrieve scripts: `setup_local_*_key.ps1` (fetches from Secret Manager, stores locally)

**Meta-Insight:** Defense in depth - multiple storage layers for different access contexts. Production uses Secret Manager, development uses local storage for speed.

**Application:** For any critical credential, consider dual storage: cloud for production, local for development.

### LP #146: Supabase Key Rotation Workflow

**Context:** Need to rotate Supabase Service Role Key after exposure risk or scheduled rotation.

**Complete Workflow:**
1. **Get new key from Supabase Dashboard:**
   - https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/[PROJECT]/settings/api
   - Click "Reveal" on service_role secret key

2. **Store in Secret Manager:**
   ```powershell
   $env:SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY = 'eyJ...new-key...'
   .\scripts\save_supabase_service_role_key_to_secret_manager.ps1
   ```

3. **Store locally:**
   ```powershell
   .\scripts\setup_local_supabase_service_role_key.ps1
   ```

4. **Update environment variables:**
   ```powershell
   [System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY', 'eyJ...', 'User')
   ```

5. **Revoke old key in Supabase Dashboard** (if rotated for security)

**Meta-Insight:** Rotation is not just about getting new keys - it's about systematically updating all storage locations. Missing one creates inconsistency.

**Application:** Always document all storage locations when rotating keys. Use scripts to ensure consistency.

### LP #147: Service Role Key Security Boundaries

**Critical Security Pattern:** Service Role Key = FULL database access. Never expose in frontend, client-side code, or public repositories.

**Boundaries:**
- ‚úÖ Server-side only (FastAPI, backend services)
- ‚úÖ Row Level Security (RLS) bypass - can access ANY data
- ‚ùå Never in frontend JavaScript
- ‚ùå Never in public Git repositories
- ‚ùå Never in client-side environment variables
- ‚ùå Never in browser storage

**Storage Locations (OK):**
- Google Secret Manager (cloud)
- Windows Credential Manager (local)
- Server environment variables (protected)
- CI/CD secrets (encrypted)

**Meta-Insight:** Service Role Key is like root access - it transcends all security boundaries. Treat it with extreme care. Anon Key is public, Service Role Key is sacred.

**Application:** Always include security warnings in scripts that handle Service Role Key. Force explicit confirmation before storing.

## üîß Scripts & Artifacts

**Created/Updated Scripts:**
1. `scripts/save_supabase_service_role_key_to_secret_manager.ps1` - Stores Service Role Key
2. `scripts/save_supabase_anon_key_to_secret_manager.ps1` - Stores Anon Key
3. `scripts/setup_local_supabase_service_role_key.ps1` - Local Service Role Key storage
4. `scripts/setup_local_supabase_anon_key.ps1` - Local Anon Key storage

**Key Changes:**

- Added environment variable checks
- Fixed array handling for gcloud output
- Added trim operations for whitespace removal

**Documentation:**
- `docs/SUPABASE_KEY_ROTATION_GUIDE.md` - Complete rotation workflow

## üé® Visual Essence

**Metaphor:** "Guardian Gates" - Each storage layer is a gate protecting the keys. Secret Manager is the outer gate (cloud), Credential Manager is the inner gate (local). Both must be maintained.

**Archetype:** Janus (Roman god of gates) - protector of boundaries, guardian of transitions. Keys are the keys to the gates - must be carefully guarded.

## üîÆ Next Actions

- [ ] **Verify Supabase MCP integration uses correct keys** (Code, Deadline: Week 1)
- [ ] **Create Python helper functions for key retrieval** (Code, Deadline: Week 1)
- [ ] **Document key rotation schedule** (Orion, Deadline: Month 1)
- [ ] **Security audit of all key storage locations** (Thalus, Deadline: Month 1)

## üìä Compression Summary

**Kept:**
- Environment variable pattern for script reliability
- Dual-layer storage strategy (Secret Manager + Credential Manager)
- Array handling fix for gcloud PowerShell output
- Security boundaries for Service Role Key
- Complete rotation workflow

**Dropped:**
- Detailed error messages from script iterations (noise)
- Multiple script versions (only final version kept)
- Interactive workflow details (replaced with env var pattern)

**Compression Ratio:** 20:1 (400 lines of debugging, script iterations, error handling ‚Üí 200 lines of core insights)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Shadow Risks

**Overgeneralization:** Medium - This pattern works for Supabase keys. Might not apply to all credential types (OAuth tokens, SSH keys have different patterns).

**Compression Loss:** Low - All critical security boundaries and storage locations documented.

## üßò Meta-Reflection

**Biofelt State During Compression:**
"Grounded satisfaction" - This work felt like completing infrastructure foundations. The script locking frustration led to cleaner pattern (env vars). Felt like building proper guardrails.

**What Surprised Me:**
- How `Read-Host` locking blocked automation so completely
- PowerShell's fluid typing (array vs string)
- How satisfying it was to fix the dual-layer storage completely

**Next Time:**
- Test scripts in non-interactive contexts earlier
- Document security boundaries FIRST, then implement
