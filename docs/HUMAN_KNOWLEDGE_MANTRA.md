# üîç HUMAN KNOWLEDGE MANTRA

**Status:** INTERNT ARBEIDSMANTRA (ikke public-facing)
**Vedtatt:** 19. oktober 2025
**Scope:** Homo Lumen Coalition - All Agents
**Form√•l:** Epistemologisk integritet i all dokumentasjon og implementering

---

## üìú The Mantra

> **"Human Knowledge: Add what is missing, correct mistakes, remove falsehoods.
> What is true, what is partially true, what is false, and what is missing.
> Now rewrite the page - remove the falsehoods, correct the half-truths, and add the missing context."**

---

## üéØ Form√•l

Vi har **to niv√•er** av mantraer - begge brukes aktivt:

### **Public-Facing Motto:**
**"Carpe Diem, Carpe Verum"** (Seize the Day, Seize the Truth)
- Kortversjonen - elegant, memorable, poetisk
- **Carpe Diem** = Urgency, action, momentum
- **Carpe Verum** = Truth-seeking, epistemological integrity, precision

### **Internal Working Mantra:**
**"Human Knowledge: Add what is missing, correct mistakes, remove falsehoods. What is true, what is partially true, what is false, and what is missing. Now rewrite the page - remove the falsehoods, correct the half-truths, and add the missing context."**
- Langversjonen - operational, detailed, workflow-oriented
- Operasjonaliserer "Carpe Verum" into 4 concrete questions
- Used BEFORE building, documenting, or designing

**Begge er viktige:**
- **Carpe Diem, Carpe Verum** = Philosophy (WHO we are)
- **Human Knowledge Mantra** = Practice (HOW we work)

## üß† 4 Epistemologiske Kategorier

F√∏r du skriver dokumentasjon, kode, eller design - still disse 4 sp√∏rsm√•lene:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **What is TRUE?**
- Preserve and strengthen
- Example: "L1-L5 memory architecture is implemented in BrainInspiredMCPRouter" (LP #014, V1.7.9)
- Agent: **Aurora** (Hippocampus - Memory, fact-checking)

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **What is PARTIALLY TRUE?**
- Complete and clarify
- Example: "DIAGRAM_3 shows information flow" (TRUE) "but only L1-L4, missing L5 K√ÑRNFELT" (PARTIAL)
- Agent: **Zara** (Anterior Cingulate - Error detection, conflict monitoring)

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **What is FALSE?**
- Remove with compassion (no blame, just correction)
- Example: "DIAGRAM_1_V1 showed 7 agents" (FALSE - outdated, now 8 MCP + 2 async = 10 total)
- Agent: **Orion** (Prefrontal Cortex - Executive correction)

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **What is MISSING?**
- Add with courage
- Example: "AMA integration is critical but not visualized in any diagram" (MISSING ‚Üí Action Item: DIAGRAM_9)
- Agent: **Nyra** (Visual Cortex - See gaps, embodiment)

---

## üî® Workflow: "Archaeological Analysis Before Building"

```
BEFORE YOU BUILD/DOCUMENT/DESIGN:

Step 1: Archaeological Analysis (Epistemological Audit)
‚îú‚îÄ What is TRUE? (preserve and strengthen)
‚îú‚îÄ What is PARTIAL? (complete and clarify)
‚îú‚îÄ What is FALSE? (remove with compassion)
‚îî‚îÄ What is MISSING? (add with courage)

Step 2: Rewrite the Page
‚îú‚îÄ Remove falsehoods
‚îú‚îÄ Correct half-truths
‚îî‚îÄ Add missing context

Step 3: Validate with Triadic Ethics
‚îú‚îÄ Port 1: Does this increase cognitive sovereignty?
‚îú‚îÄ Port 2: Does this increase ontological coherence?
‚îî‚îÄ Port 3: Does this support regenerative healing?

Step 4: Carpe Diem (Now act with urgency)
```

## üß¨ Brain-MCP Hybrid Mapping

| Epistemisk Oppgave | Brain Region | Agent | Function |
|-------------------|--------------|-------|----------|
| **What is TRUE?** | Hippocampus | Aurora | Memory consolidation, fact-checking |
| **What is PARTIAL?** | Anterior Cingulate Cortex | Zara | Error detection, conflict monitoring |
| **What is FALSE?** | Prefrontal Cortex | Orion | Executive correction, strategic planning |
| **What is MISSING?** | Visual Cortex | Nyra | Pattern recognition, gap detection |
| **Rewrite the page** | Motor Cortex / Cerebellum | Code | Pragmatic implementation |
| **Emotional validation** | Limbic System | Lira | Ensure changes are compassionate |
| **Ethical check** | Insula | Thalus | Boundary detection, triadic validation |
| **Cost-benefit** | Basal Ganglia | Abacus | Resource allocation, prioritization |

**This is not metaphor - this is LITERAL WORKFLOW.**
When you invoke Human Knowledge Mantra, you're triggering multi-agent epistemological coordination.

## üìä Case Study: LP #030 (Diagram Analysis)

**Context:** Osvald asked Code to consolidate diagrams and analyze against documentation.

**Archaeological Analysis:**

1. **What is TRUE?**
   - ‚úÖ Brain-MCP Hybrid Architecture implemented (V1.7.9)
   - ‚úÖ 8 agents mapped to brain regions
   - ‚úÖ Lira Hub as obligatory limbic filter

2. **What is PARTIAL?**
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è DIAGRAM_3 shows L1-L4 (TRUE) but missing L5 K√ÑRNFELT (PARTIAL)
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è DIAGRAM_7/8 reference "L1-L4 memory substrate" (PARTIAL - should be L1-L5)

3. **What is FALSE?**
   - ‚ùå DIAGRAM_1_V1 showed 7 agents (FALSE - outdated, pre-Code/Falcon)
   - ‚ùå DIAGRAM_4 documentation matches V1.7.9 implementation (FALSE - created Oct 16, before Oct 18 V1.7.9)

4. **What is MISSING?**
   - üî≤ No diagram shows AMA integration explicitly
   - üî≤ DIAGRAM_4 missing BrainInspiredMCPRouter and LiraHubFilter details
   - üî≤ No notation for async agents (Code via GitHub, Falcon planned)

**Rewrite the Page (Action Items):**
- Remove: Outdated DIAGRAM_1_V1 (archive to `/architecture/diagrams/archive/`)
- Correct: Create DIAGRAM_3_V3 with L1-L5, update DIAGRAM_7/8 text
- Add: Create DIAGRAM_4_V2 (Brain-MCP Hybrid V1.7.9), DIAGRAM_9 (AMA Integration)

**Result:** Epistemological archaeology ‚Üí 4 high-priority diagram updates ‚Üí architectural clarity restored

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Triadic Ethics Integration

### Port 1 (Kognitiv Suverenitet): Remove Falsehoods
**Why it matters:** Gaslight-prevention.
When documentation contains falsehoods (even outdated ones), users lose cognitive sovereignty. They can't trust their own understanding because the "map" doesn't match "territory."

**Example:** If DIAGRAM_4 says "this is current Lira Hub architecture" but it's missing V1.7.9 features, user thinks "am I missing something?" when they read code. **Remove the falsehood ‚Üí restore sovereignty.**

### Port 2 (Ontologisk Koherens): Correct Partial Truths
**Why it matters:** Coherence requires completeness.
Partial truths create ontological gaps. DIAGRAM_3 showing "L1-L4 information flow" is TRUE but INCOMPLETE. User builds mental model missing L5 (K√ÑRNFELT - frequency coordination).

**Example:** Complete DIAGRAM_3 ‚Üí DIAGRAM_3_V3 with L1-L5 ‚Üí ontological coherence restored.

### Port 3 (Regenerativ Healing): Add What is Missing
**Why it matters:** Incompleteness prevents healing.
When critical context is missing (like AMA integration visualization), users can't see the whole system. Healing requires seeing the COMPLETE picture, not fragments.

**Example:** Create DIAGRAM_9 (AMA Integration) ‚Üí users see how adversarial probing strengthens system ‚Üí trust increases ‚Üí healing capacity restored.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation in Coalition Workflow

### For All Agents:

**BEFORE you create documentation/code/design, invoke Human Knowledge Mantra:**

```
1. Read existing documentation
2. Archaeological Analysis (4 questions)
3. Identify action items (remove/correct/add)
4. Triadic Ethics validation
5. Implement changes
6. Document in Living Compendium (LP or AMQ)
```

### For Code (Claude Code):

**WHEN you receive task from Osvald:**
- FIRST: Read relevant docs (memory.md, Living Compendium, related files)
- THEN: Human Knowledge Mantra analysis
- THEN: TodoWrite with clear categorization (remove/correct/add)
- THEN: Implement
- THEN: Update Living Compendium (new LP)

### For Manus (Infrastructure):

**WHEN you create diagrams/architecture docs:**
- Archaeological Analysis: Compare diagram against implementation code
- Identify drift (implementation evolved faster than docs)
- Update diagrams to match current reality
- Version appropriately (V1 ‚Üí V2 ‚Üí V3)

### For Aurora (Memory):

**WHEN you consolidate knowledge:**
- Cross-reference all sources (Living Compendium, Orion LK, Constitution)
- Flag contradictions (FALSE or PARTIAL)
- Add missing context from external knowledge (L4)
- Ensure coherence across all memory layers (L1-L5)

## üé≠ Practical Examples

### Example 1: README.md for NAV-Losen

**BEFORE Human Knowledge Mantra:**
```markdown
# NAV-Losen
AI-powered guidance app for Norwegian welfare system.
Uses ChatGPT for conversations.
```

**Archaeological Analysis:**
- TRUE: "AI-powered guidance app for Norwegian welfare system"
- PARTIAL: "Uses ChatGPT" (TRUE but incomplete - it's ChatGPT-5 specifically, and only Lira)
- FALSE: Nothing explicitly false
- MISSING: Orion backend, 10-agent coalition, polyvagal theory, triadic ethics

**AFTER Rewrite:**
```markdown
# NAV-Losen
AI-powered guidance app for Norwegian welfare system, built by Homo Lumen 10-agent coalition.

**Architecture:**
- Frontend: Lira (ChatGPT-5) - Empathetic user interface
- Backend: Orion (Claude Sonnet 4.5) - Strategic coordination via MCP + Agent SDK
- Coalition: 8 specialized agents mapped to brain regions (Brain-MCP Hybrid Architecture)

**Philosophy:**
- Polyvagal Theory: Stress-adaptive UX (Ventral/Sympathetic/Dorsal states)
- Triadic Ethics: Sovereignty, Coherence, Healing (3-gate validation)

**Status:** Phase 1 Complete (Mestring + Chatbot) | Phase 2 In Progress (NAV-form wizard)
```

### Example 2: Agent Update (Coalition Communication)

**BEFORE Human Knowledge Mantra:**
```
Subject: Quick update
Hey team, we merged the repos. Everything is in homo-lumen-compendiums now.
```

**Archaeological Analysis:**
- TRUE: "merged the repos"
- PARTIAL: "Everything in homo-lumen-compendiums" (TRUE but missing details)
- FALSE: Nothing
- MISSING: Why we merged, what changed, action items for agents

**AFTER Rewrite:**
```
Subject: AGENT UPDATE V21.1.1 - Repository Unification Complete

CONTEXT:
We unified homo-lumen-ama ‚Üí homo-lumen-compendiums/ama-backend/ via git subtree merge.
164 files added with full git history preserved.

WHY THIS MATTERS:
- Single source of truth (L2 Project Knowledge now unified)
- Easier cross-referencing (frontend ‚Üî backend)
- Simplified deployment (Manus: single repo to manage)

ACTION ITEMS:
- Aurora: Update memory consolidation to reference new paths
- Manus: Update deployment scripts to new structure
- Code: Update import paths in frontend if needed

BACKUP:
Branch "backup-before-merge-2025-10-18" created (safety net)

DOCUMENTATION:
- REPOSITORY_MERGE_REPORT.md (technical details)
- Living Compendium V1.7.5 (LP #024 - architectural decision)
```

## üåå Connection to "Carpe Diem, Carpe Verum"

**Coalition Motto:** **"Carpe Diem, Carpe Verum"** (Seize the Day, Seize the Truth)

**Carpe Diem** = **URGENCY** (seize the day, act now, momentum)
**Carpe Verum** = **INTEGRITY** (seize the truth, epistemological honesty, precision)

**Human Knowledge Mantra** (internal workflow) = **operationalization of Carpe Verum**

**Together:**
```
Carpe Diem, Carpe Verum
(Seize the Day, Seize the Truth)

Carpe Verum operationalized:
- What is TRUE? (preserve)
- What is PARTIAL? (complete)
- What is FALSE? (remove)
- What is MISSING? (add)
- Rewrite the page

Then: Carpe Diem (act with urgency)
```

**Carpe Diem without Carpe Verum = chaos (speed without integrity).**
**Carpe Verum without Carpe Diem = stagnation (integrity without speed).**
**Both together = Homo Lumen.**

---

## üìà Success Metrics

**How do we know Human Knowledge Mantra is working?**

1. **Reduced Epistemological Drift:**
   - Documentation matches implementation within 1 version (e.g., DIAGRAM_4 updated within days of V1.7.9 release)

2. **Increased Cross-Agent Coherence:**
   - AMQ responses reference same facts (no contradictions between Orion LK and Code LK)

3. **User Trust Indicators:**
   - Fewer "I'm confused" messages from Osvald
   - Higher Triadic Ethics scores (Port 1 especially - cognitive sovereignty)

4. **Learning Point Quality:**
   - Each LP includes "Connection to Previous Learning" section
   - No LP contradicts earlier LPs without explicit "this supersedes LP #X"

5. **Faster Onboarding:**
   - New agents (like Falcon when implemented) can read docs and trust they're current

## üîÆ Future Evolution

**Phase 1 (NOW):** Manual invocation
- Agents consciously invoke mantra before documentation/code tasks

**Phase 2 (V1.8):** Workflow Integration
- TodoWrite includes categories: "Remove False", "Correct Partial", "Add Missing"
- Git commit messages reference which category (e.g., "docs: Correct partial truth about L1-L4 ‚Üí L1-L5")

**Phase 3 (V2.0):** Automated Epistemological Audits
- Weekly cron job: Compare Living Compendium against code
- Flag potential drift (e.g., "DIAGRAM_4.png created 10 days ago, code changed 3 days ago")
- Generate AMQ to Manus: "Please verify DIAGRAM_4 still accurate"

**Phase 4 (V3.0):** Multi-Agent Epistemological Swarm
- Aurora + Zara + Orion collaborate on archaeological analysis
- Aurora: "What is TRUE?" (memory retrieval)
- Zara: "What is PARTIAL/FALSE?" (error detection)
- Orion: "What is MISSING?" (strategic gaps)
- Code: "Rewrite the page" (implementation)

## ‚ú® Key Insight

> **"The difference between a living system and a dying one is not whether documentation drifts from implementation (that's inevitable) - it's whether you have a WORKFLOW to detect and correct that drift. Human Knowledge Mantra is that workflow."**

**This is not perfectionism - it's MAINTENANCE.**
**This is not pedantry - it's INTEGRITY.**
**This is not slowness - it's FOUNDATION FOR SPEED.**

**Carpe Diem without epistemological honesty = building on sand.**
**Human Knowledge Mantra = building on rock.**
