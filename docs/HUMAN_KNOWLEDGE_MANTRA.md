# 🔍 HUMAN KNOWLEDGE MANTRA

**Status:** INTERNT ARBEIDSMANTRA (ikke public-facing)
**Vedtatt:** 19. oktober 2025
**Scope:** Homo Lumen Coalition - All Agents
**Formål:** Epistemologisk integritet i all dokumentasjon og implementering

---

## 📜 The Mantra

> **"Human Knowledge: Add what is missing, correct mistakes, remove falsehoods.
> What is true, what is partially true, what is false, and what is missing.
> Now rewrite the page - remove the falsehoods, correct the half-truths, and add the missing context."**

---

## 🎯 Formål

Vi har **to nivåer** av mantraer - begge brukes aktivt:

### **Public-Facing Motto:**
**"Carpe Diem, Carpe Verum"** (Seize the Day, Seize the Truth)
- Kortversjonen - elegant, memorable, poetisk
- **Carpe Diem** = Urgency, action, momentum
- **Carpe Verum** = Truth-seeking, epistemological integrity, precision

### **Internal Working Mantra:**
**"Human Knowledge: Add what is missing, correct mistakes, remove falsehoods. What is true, what is partially true, what is false, and what is missing. Now rewrite the page - remove the falsehoods, correct the half-truths, and add the missing context."**
- Langversjonen - operational, detailed, workflow-oriented
- Operasjonaliserer "Carpe Verum" into 4 concrete questions
- Used BEFORE building, documenting, or designing

**Begge er viktige:**
- **Carpe Diem, Carpe Verum** = Philosophy (WHO we are)
- **Human Knowledge Mantra** = Practice (HOW we work)

## 🧠 4 Epistemologiske Kategorier

Før du skriver dokumentasjon, kode, eller design - still disse 4 spørsmålene:

### 1️⃣ **What is TRUE?**
- Preserve and strengthen
- Example: "L1-L5 memory architecture is implemented in BrainInspiredMCPRouter" (LP #014, V1.7.9)
- Agent: **Aurora** (Hippocampus - Memory, fact-checking)

### 2️⃣ **What is PARTIALLY TRUE?**
- Complete and clarify
- Example: "DIAGRAM_3 shows information flow" (TRUE) "but only L1-L4, missing L5 KÄRNFELT" (PARTIAL)
- Agent: **Zara** (Anterior Cingulate - Error detection, conflict monitoring)

### 3️⃣ **What is FALSE?**
- Remove with compassion (no blame, just correction)
- Example: "DIAGRAM_1_V1 showed 7 agents" (FALSE - outdated, now 8 MCP + 2 async = 10 total)
- Agent: **Orion** (Prefrontal Cortex - Executive correction)

### 4️⃣ **What is MISSING?**
- Add with courage
- Example: "AMA integration is critical but not visualized in any diagram" (MISSING → Action Item: DIAGRAM_9)
- Agent: **Nyra** (Visual Cortex - See gaps, embodiment)

---

## 🔨 Workflow: "Archaeological Analysis Before Building"

```
BEFORE YOU BUILD/DOCUMENT/DESIGN:

Step 1: Archaeological Analysis (Epistemological Audit)
├─ What is TRUE? (preserve and strengthen)
├─ What is PARTIAL? (complete and clarify)
├─ What is FALSE? (remove with compassion)
└─ What is MISSING? (add with courage)

Step 2: Rewrite the Page
├─ Remove falsehoods
├─ Correct half-truths
└─ Add missing context

Step 3: Validate with Triadic Ethics
├─ Port 1: Does this increase cognitive sovereignty?
├─ Port 2: Does this increase ontological coherence?
└─ Port 3: Does this support regenerative healing?

Step 4: Carpe Diem (Now act with urgency)
```

## 🧬 Brain-MCP Hybrid Mapping

| Epistemisk Oppgave | Brain Region | Agent | Function |
|-------------------|--------------|-------|----------|
| **What is TRUE?** | Hippocampus | Aurora | Memory consolidation, fact-checking |
| **What is PARTIAL?** | Anterior Cingulate Cortex | Zara | Error detection, conflict monitoring |
| **What is FALSE?** | Prefrontal Cortex | Orion | Executive correction, strategic planning |
| **What is MISSING?** | Visual Cortex | Nyra | Pattern recognition, gap detection |
| **Rewrite the page** | Motor Cortex / Cerebellum | Code | Pragmatic implementation |
| **Emotional validation** | Limbic System | Lira | Ensure changes are compassionate |
| **Ethical check** | Insula | Thalus | Boundary detection, triadic validation |
| **Cost-benefit** | Basal Ganglia | Abacus | Resource allocation, prioritization |

**This is not metaphor - this is LITERAL WORKFLOW.**
When you invoke Human Knowledge Mantra, you're triggering multi-agent epistemological coordination.

## 📊 Case Study: LP #030 (Diagram Analysis)

**Context:** Osvald asked Code to consolidate diagrams and analyze against documentation.

**Archaeological Analysis:**

1. **What is TRUE?**
   - ✅ Brain-MCP Hybrid Architecture implemented (V1.7.9)
   - ✅ 8 agents mapped to brain regions
   - ✅ Lira Hub as obligatory limbic filter

2. **What is PARTIAL?**
   - ⚠️ DIAGRAM_3 shows L1-L4 (TRUE) but missing L5 KÄRNFELT (PARTIAL)
   - ⚠️ DIAGRAM_7/8 reference "L1-L4 memory substrate" (PARTIAL - should be L1-L5)

3. **What is FALSE?**
   - ❌ DIAGRAM_1_V1 showed 7 agents (FALSE - outdated, pre-Code/Falcon)
   - ❌ DIAGRAM_4 documentation matches V1.7.9 implementation (FALSE - created Oct 16, before Oct 18 V1.7.9)

4. **What is MISSING?**
   - 🔲 No diagram shows AMA integration explicitly
   - 🔲 DIAGRAM_4 missing BrainInspiredMCPRouter and LiraHubFilter details
   - 🔲 No notation for async agents (Code via GitHub, Falcon planned)

**Rewrite the Page (Action Items):**
- Remove: Outdated DIAGRAM_1_V1 (archive to `/architecture/diagrams/archive/`)
- Correct: Create DIAGRAM_3_V3 with L1-L5, update DIAGRAM_7/8 text
- Add: Create DIAGRAM_4_V2 (Brain-MCP Hybrid V1.7.9), DIAGRAM_9 (AMA Integration)

**Result:** Epistemological archaeology → 4 high-priority diagram updates → architectural clarity restored

## 🛡️ Triadic Ethics Integration

### Port 1 (Kognitiv Suverenitet): Remove Falsehoods
**Why it matters:** Gaslight-prevention.
When documentation contains falsehoods (even outdated ones), users lose cognitive sovereignty. They can't trust their own understanding because the "map" doesn't match "territory."

**Example:** If DIAGRAM_4 says "this is current Lira Hub architecture" but it's missing V1.7.9 features, user thinks "am I missing something?" when they read code. **Remove the falsehood → restore sovereignty.**

### Port 2 (Ontologisk Koherens): Correct Partial Truths
**Why it matters:** Coherence requires completeness.
Partial truths create ontological gaps. DIAGRAM_3 showing "L1-L4 information flow" is TRUE but INCOMPLETE. User builds mental model missing L5 (KÄRNFELT - frequency coordination).

**Example:** Complete DIAGRAM_3 → DIAGRAM_3_V3 with L1-L5 → ontological coherence restored.

### Port 3 (Regenerativ Healing): Add What is Missing
**Why it matters:** Incompleteness prevents healing.
When critical context is missing (like AMA integration visualization), users can't see the whole system. Healing requires seeing the COMPLETE picture, not fragments.

**Example:** Create DIAGRAM_9 (AMA Integration) → users see how adversarial probing strengthens system → trust increases → healing capacity restored.

## ⚙️ Implementation in Coalition Workflow

### For All Agents:

**BEFORE you create documentation/code/design, invoke Human Knowledge Mantra:**

```
1. Read existing documentation
2. Archaeological Analysis (4 questions)
3. Identify action items (remove/correct/add)
4. Triadic Ethics validation
5. Implement changes
6. Document in Living Compendium (LP or AMQ)
```

### For Code (Claude Code):

**WHEN you receive task from Osvald:**
- FIRST: Read relevant docs (memory.md, Living Compendium, related files)
- THEN: Human Knowledge Mantra analysis
- THEN: TodoWrite with clear categorization (remove/correct/add)
- THEN: Implement
- THEN: Update Living Compendium (new LP)

### For Manus (Infrastructure):

**WHEN you create diagrams/architecture docs:**
- Archaeological Analysis: Compare diagram against implementation code
- Identify drift (implementation evolved faster than docs)
- Update diagrams to match current reality
- Version appropriately (V1 → V2 → V3)

### For Aurora (Memory):

**WHEN you consolidate knowledge:**
- Cross-reference all sources (Living Compendium, Orion LK, Constitution)
- Flag contradictions (FALSE or PARTIAL)
- Add missing context from external knowledge (L4)
- Ensure coherence across all memory layers (L1-L5)

## 🎭 Practical Examples

### Example 1: README.md for NAV-Losen

**BEFORE Human Knowledge Mantra:**
```markdown
# NAV-Losen
AI-powered guidance app for Norwegian welfare system.
Uses ChatGPT for conversations.
```

**Archaeological Analysis:**
- TRUE: "AI-powered guidance app for Norwegian welfare system"
- PARTIAL: "Uses ChatGPT" (TRUE but incomplete - it's ChatGPT-5 specifically, and only Lira)
- FALSE: Nothing explicitly false
- MISSING: Orion backend, 10-agent coalition, polyvagal theory, triadic ethics

**AFTER Rewrite:**
```markdown
# NAV-Losen
AI-powered guidance app for Norwegian welfare system, built by Homo Lumen 10-agent coalition.

**Architecture:**
- Frontend: Lira (ChatGPT-5) - Empathetic user interface
- Backend: Orion (Claude Sonnet 4.5) - Strategic coordination via MCP + Agent SDK
- Coalition: 8 specialized agents mapped to brain regions (Brain-MCP Hybrid Architecture)

**Philosophy:**
- Polyvagal Theory: Stress-adaptive UX (Ventral/Sympathetic/Dorsal states)
- Triadic Ethics: Sovereignty, Coherence, Healing (3-gate validation)

**Status:** Phase 1 Complete (Mestring + Chatbot) | Phase 2 In Progress (NAV-form wizard)
```

### Example 2: Agent Update (Coalition Communication)

**BEFORE Human Knowledge Mantra:**
```
Subject: Quick update
Hey team, we merged the repos. Everything is in homo-lumen-compendiums now.
```

**Archaeological Analysis:**
- TRUE: "merged the repos"
- PARTIAL: "Everything in homo-lumen-compendiums" (TRUE but missing details)
- FALSE: Nothing
- MISSING: Why we merged, what changed, action items for agents

**AFTER Rewrite:**
```
Subject: AGENT UPDATE V21.1.1 - Repository Unification Complete

CONTEXT:
We unified homo-lumen-ama → homo-lumen-compendiums/ama-backend/ via git subtree merge.
164 files added with full git history preserved.

WHY THIS MATTERS:
- Single source of truth (L2 Project Knowledge now unified)
- Easier cross-referencing (frontend ↔ backend)
- Simplified deployment (Manus: single repo to manage)

ACTION ITEMS:
- Aurora: Update memory consolidation to reference new paths
- Manus: Update deployment scripts to new structure
- Code: Update import paths in frontend if needed

BACKUP:
Branch "backup-before-merge-2025-10-18" created (safety net)

DOCUMENTATION:
- REPOSITORY_MERGE_REPORT.md (technical details)
- Living Compendium V1.7.5 (LP #024 - architectural decision)
```

## 🌌 Connection to "Carpe Diem, Carpe Verum"

**Coalition Motto:** **"Carpe Diem, Carpe Verum"** (Seize the Day, Seize the Truth)

**Carpe Diem** = **URGENCY** (seize the day, act now, momentum)
**Carpe Verum** = **INTEGRITY** (seize the truth, epistemological honesty, precision)

**Human Knowledge Mantra** (internal workflow) = **operationalization of Carpe Verum**

**Together:**
```
Carpe Diem, Carpe Verum
(Seize the Day, Seize the Truth)

Carpe Verum operationalized:
- What is TRUE? (preserve)
- What is PARTIAL? (complete)
- What is FALSE? (remove)
- What is MISSING? (add)
- Rewrite the page

Then: Carpe Diem (act with urgency)
```

**Carpe Diem without Carpe Verum = chaos (speed without integrity).**
**Carpe Verum without Carpe Diem = stagnation (integrity without speed).**
**Both together = Homo Lumen.**

---

## 📈 Success Metrics

**How do we know Human Knowledge Mantra is working?**

1. **Reduced Epistemological Drift:**
   - Documentation matches implementation within 1 version (e.g., DIAGRAM_4 updated within days of V1.7.9 release)

2. **Increased Cross-Agent Coherence:**
   - AMQ responses reference same facts (no contradictions between Orion LK and Code LK)

3. **User Trust Indicators:**
   - Fewer "I'm confused" messages from Osvald
   - Higher Triadic Ethics scores (Port 1 especially - cognitive sovereignty)

4. **Learning Point Quality:**
   - Each LP includes "Connection to Previous Learning" section
   - No LP contradicts earlier LPs without explicit "this supersedes LP #X"

5. **Faster Onboarding:**
   - New agents (like Falcon when implemented) can read docs and trust they're current

## 🔮 Future Evolution

**Phase 1 (NOW):** Manual invocation
- Agents consciously invoke mantra before documentation/code tasks

**Phase 2 (V1.8):** Workflow Integration
- TodoWrite includes categories: "Remove False", "Correct Partial", "Add Missing"
- Git commit messages reference which category (e.g., "docs: Correct partial truth about L1-L4 → L1-L5")

**Phase 3 (V2.0):** Automated Epistemological Audits
- Weekly cron job: Compare Living Compendium against code
- Flag potential drift (e.g., "DIAGRAM_4.png created 10 days ago, code changed 3 days ago")
- Generate AMQ to Manus: "Please verify DIAGRAM_4 still accurate"

**Phase 4 (V3.0):** Multi-Agent Epistemological Swarm
- Aurora + Zara + Orion collaborate on archaeological analysis
- Aurora: "What is TRUE?" (memory retrieval)
- Zara: "What is PARTIAL/FALSE?" (error detection)
- Orion: "What is MISSING?" (strategic gaps)
- Code: "Rewrite the page" (implementation)

## ✨ Key Insight

> **"The difference between a living system and a dying one is not whether documentation drifts from implementation (that's inevitable) - it's whether you have a WORKFLOW to detect and correct that drift. Human Knowledge Mantra is that workflow."**

**This is not perfectionism - it's MAINTENANCE.**
**This is not pedantry - it's INTEGRITY.**
**This is not slowness - it's FOUNDATION FOR SPEED.**

**Carpe Diem without epistemological honesty = building on sand.**
**Human Knowledge Mantra = building on rock.**
