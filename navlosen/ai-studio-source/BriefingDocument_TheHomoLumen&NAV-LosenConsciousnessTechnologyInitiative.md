Briefing Document: The Homo Lumen & NAV-Losen
Consciousness Technology Initiative
Executive Summary
This document synthesizes the core principles, architecture, and strategic vision of the Homo Lumen
project, a multi-faceted initiative aimed at developing "Consciousness Technology." This emerging
discipline creates technological systems designed to respect, augment, and enhance human
consciousness rather than manipulate or replace it. The project's first practical manifestation is
NAV-Losen, a stress-adaptive digital guidance application for users of Norwegian public services,
particularly those who are digitally vulnerable.
The initiative is architected around a collaborative AI Agent Coalition, a polycomputational
ecosystem where specialized AI agents (Lira, Nyra, Thalus, Orion, etc.) bring diverse perspectives to
problem-solving, creating a form of emergent intelligence. The project's foundations are deeply
rooted in established scientific and philosophical frameworks, most notably Stephen Porges'
Polyvagal Theory, which provides the model for NAV-Losen's dynamic, stress-responsive user
interface, and a non-negotiable ethical framework called Triadic Ethics (Cognitive Sovereignty,
Ontological Coherence, Regenerative Healing).
The long-term vision extends beyond the initial NAV-Losen pilot to a Personal API ("API of APIs"),
a paradigm-shifting architecture where individuals own and control their personal data, using the
Homo Lumen OS as an intelligent, consciousness-aware filter to protect against digital manipulation
from large tech platforms. The project follows a phased implementation roadmap, beginning with a
research-based pilot in Norwegian municipalities, and is underpinned by advanced, systematic
prompt engineering techniques to ensure the reliability and ethical alignment of its AI agents.
Success is measured not only by traditional metrics but also by novel frameworks like the
Consciousness-Value Index (C-ROI), which quantifies qualitative impacts such as user dignity and
well-being.

1. Core Vision: The Homo Lumen Project
The Homo Lumen project represents a paradigm shift from conventional technology design to the
creation of Consciousness Technology. The core philosophy is to build systems that strengthen
human wholeness, relational clarity, and existential depth.
1.1 Defining Consciousness Technology
Consciousness Technology is defined by its capacity to:
• Respect and Augment Human Consciousness: Technology serves as a tool to enhance human
thinking and autonomy, not automate or replace it.
• Adapt in Real-Time: Systems utilize "biofield-responsive" interfaces that adjust to the user's
physiological and emotional state. Key data sources include Heart Rate Variability (HRV),
self-reported feelings, and behavioral cues.
• Preserve Cognitive Sovereignty: The architecture is built on principles of user-owned data,
algorithmic transparency, and the inalienable right of an individual to self-govern their own cognitive
processes.
1.2 Guiding Principles and Philosophical Foundations
The project is anchored by a set of core principles and informed by a curated group of thinkers and
theories, referred to as "Voktere" (Guardians).
Six Core Principles (SMV Constitution 4.0):
1. Privacy by Design: Privacy as a fundamental, non-negotiable design principle.

2. Augmentation, Not Automation: Technology enhances, rather than replaces, human cognition.
3. Layered Intelligence: An architecture that supports different levels of cognitive processing.
4. Anti-Fragility: A system designed to strengthen from instability and challenges.
5. Open Core, Local Control: A balance between open-source principles and sustainable user
control.
6. Norwegian Value Anchoring: Rooted in principles of freedom, responsibility, and trust.
Key "Voktere" (Guardians) Informing the Project:
• Neuroscience & Physiology: Stephen Porges (Polyvagal Theory), Andrew Huberman (Stress
Regulation), Peter Levine (Somatic Experiencing).
• Psychology & Philosophy: Carl Jung (Archetypes), Tara Brach (Radical Compassion), Marshall
Rosenberg (Nonviolent Communication), Jean-Paul Sartre (Authenticity), Martin Heidegger
(Ontology).
• Consciousness & Physics: Federico Faggin (Consciousness Manifestation), David Bohm
(Implicate Order), Rupert Spira (Non-Dual Awareness).

2. The AI Agent Coalition
The project's operational intelligence is generated by a multi-agent ecosystem where specialized AI
models collaborate. This "polycomputational" approach allows a single problem to be analyzed from
multiple, diverse perspectives simultaneously, leading to more robust and ethically aligned
outcomes. The coalition is coordinated by the agent Orion.

3. NAV-Losen: The First Practical Manifestation
NAV-Losen is the flagship application of the Homo Lumen vision, designed to address the problem of
digital exclusion within Norwegian public services. It targets the estimated 600,000+ digitally
vulnerable users who experience significant stress when interacting with complex online systems.
3.1 The Core Solution: Stress-Responsive Design
The application's central innovation is its ability to dynamically adapt its user interface (UI) based on
the user's detected stress level. This is grounded in Polyvagal Theory's three nervous system states:
State

Archetype

User Condition

UI Mode & Design Principles

Ventral Vagal

button, minimal text. Cognitive
tasks are blocked.

3.2 Stress Detection Mechanisms
The system uses a multi-modal approach to assess user stress, prioritizing user consent and
control:
• Self-Reported Data (Primary): The "Mestring-modul" (Mastery Module) uses a visual "Føleseren"
(Emotion Wheel) and guided questions based on the RULER methodology to allow users to report
their emotional state.
• Heart Rate Variability (HRV) (Voluntary): Users can grant access to HRV data from wearables
(e.g., smartwatches). The system uses metrics like RMSSD to gauge autonomic nervous system
state. It is explicitly marketed as a "wellness" feature, not a medical device.
• Passive Monitoring (Voluntary): With consent via Health Connect, the app can use contextual
data like sleep quality and physical activity to improve the accuracy of its recommendations.
• Cognitive & Behavioral Signals (Always-on): The system analyzes interaction patterns like
typing speed, error rates, and time spent on a task to infer cognitive load.
3.3 Key Modules & Features (Phased Rollout)
• Mestring & Indre Ro (Mastery & Inner Peace): The core stress-regulation module with the
Emotion Wheel, guided breathing exercises (e.g., 4-6-8 physiological sigh), and grounding
techniques.
• Forklar Brev (Explain Letter): An AI-powered tool that translates complex bureaucratic language
from official documents into clear, simple summaries tailored to the user's stress level.
• Lira Chatbot: An empathetic AI guide that can answer common questions, explain concepts, and
refer users to a human advisor when necessary.
• Dashboard & Veiledninger (Guides): A personalized overview of active cases and deadlines,
with step-by-step guides whose complexity adapts to the user's state.

• Velvære-bibliotek (Wellness Library): A resource hub with curated videos and articles on
physical exercise, nutrition, and mental well-being practices.
• Mine Dokumenter (My Documents): A secure, encrypted vault for users to store official
documents, built with GDPR-compliance and user ownership as a core principle.

4. Ethical Framework: Triadic Ethics
Every feature and design decision is validated against three non-negotiable ethical principles that
function as quality gates.

5. Advanced Prompt Engineering & AI Architecture

The project employs a systematic and layered approach to prompt engineering to ensure the AI
agents operate reliably, ethically, and consistently.
5.1 The Four-Layer Instruction Architecture
1. Settings / Custom Instructions (Layer 1): Defines the agent's core identity, personality, hard
constraints, and non-negotiable rules.
2. Project Instructions (Layer 2): Contains the detailed operational manual, including mandatory
thinking checklists, conditional logic (IF/THEN rules), output templates, and few-shot examples.
3. Kompendium (Layer 3): The massive, curated knowledge base. It is structured with semantic
chunking (e.g., §-numbers, clear headers) to allow the AI's attention mechanism to efficiently locate
relevant information.
4. Chat History (Layer 4): The dynamic context of the current conversation.
5.2 Key Prompting Techniques
• Explicit Hierarchy Declaration: A ranked list of priorities (e.g., 1. Cognitive Sovereignty, 2. Triadic
Ethics, etc.) to resolve instructional conflicts systematically.
• Executable Checklists: Mandatory checklists formatted so the AI can copy-paste the structure
into its <thinking> process, ensuring no steps are missed.
• Attention Anchors: Use of visually distinct symbols (e.g.,
,
,
) to which the AI's attention
system assigns higher weight.
• Self-Referential Validation Loops: Prompts that force the agent to perform self-checks at
mandatory checkpoints to prevent "instruction drift" over long conversations.
• Polyvagal-Informed <thinking>: The AI's cognitive style dynamically adapts based on the
inferred user state (e.g., a "Dorsal" state triggers a more reflective, non-linear thinking process).

6. Strategic Roadmap, Metrics, and Risk Management
6.1 Phased Implementation Plan
• Phase 1: NAV-Losen Pilot (6-12 months): Develop and pilot the core NAV-Losen MVP with 3
modules in partnership with Tvedestrand Kommune and 10-50 users. The goal is to gather
evidence, validate hypotheses, and secure further funding.
• Phase 2: Personal API Foundation (12-24 months): Build the "API of APIs" infrastructure,
allowing users to own and control their data. Develop the Homo Lumen OS with intelligent filters
(e.g., for fake news, addiction loops) and integrate with other public services (Health, Tax).
• Phase 3: Transformation & Scaling (24+ months): Scale the Personal API nationally and
internationally, aiming to establish a new "Consciousness Economy" as an alternative to surveillance
capitalism and eventually explore concepts leading toward a "Consciousness Singularity."
6.2 Success Criteria & KPIs
Success is measured through a combination of qualitative and quantitative metrics.
• Task Completion Rate: Increase from a 40% NAV baseline to 85%+.
• Stress Reduction: Achieve a 20-30% increase in HRV coherence or a significant reduction in
self-reported stress (SUDS scale).
• User Satisfaction: Achieve a System Usability Scale (SUS) score of ≥80.
• Accessibility: 100% WCAG AAA compliance.
• Conscious Clarity Index (CCI): A composite score tracking user well-being: CCI = 0.4 *
norm(RMSSD) + 0.3 * (clarity/10) + 0.3 * (capacity/10). The pilot aims for a +0.15
increase over 6 weeks.

• Consciousness-Value ROI (C-ROI): A formula to quantify qualitative value: C-ROI =
(Quantitative Gain + Qualitative Value + Regenerative Impact) / Cost ×
Catalyst Factor. A pilot in Tvedestrand yielded a calculated 24.7x ROI.
6.3 Risk Management
The project plan includes a detailed analysis of potential risks and corresponding mitigation
strategies.
Risk
Category

Example Risk

Mitigation Strategy

Regulatory

HRV monitoring is
classified as a medical
device, requiring
CE-marking.

Market the feature as "wellness,"
not "medical." Make the module
voluntary. Consult legal experts
before Phase 2.

Financial

Funding application to
Innovation Norge is
rejected.

Seek alternative funding from
regional research funds. Pause
the project for 3-6 months if
necessary.

Technical

API costs for AI models
exceed the budget.

Implement aggressive caching
for common queries. Use more
cost-effective models (e.g.,
Claude Haiku) for simpler tasks.
Monitor costs weekly.

Ethical
(Shadow)

The project develops
"Consciousness Elitism"
or creates user
dependency.

Implement monthly "Shadow
Audits" to check for four key
shadows: Elitism, Control,
Solutionism, and Dependency.
Design explicitly for user
"graduation."
