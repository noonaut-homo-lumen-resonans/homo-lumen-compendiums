## Critical Success Metrics

### Port 1: Suverenitet
- **Skip button usage:** 15-25% (users exercising control)
- **Data dashboard access:** â‰¥50% of users view their data monthly
- **Private session mode:** â‰¥10% usage (privacy-conscious users)

---

### Port 2: Koherens
- **"Why this suggestion?" expansion rate:** â‰¥40% (users seeking understanding)
- **Language feedback submissions:** â‰¥5% of users suggest improvements
- **Science context views:** â‰¥30% (users reading evidence)

---

### Port 3: Healing
- **Mastery Log entries:** â‰¥3 strategies per user within 1 month
- **Graduation indicator:** 20% reduction in session frequency after 3 months
- **RAIN module completion:** â‰¥60% of users complete at least once
- **Self-efficacy increase:** Measured via post-session survey (target: +25%)

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **LocalStorage limits:** Implement fallback to IndexedDB if data exceeds 10MB
- **API failures:** Graceful degradation (e.g., weather API down â†’ skip weather suggestions)
- **Browser compatibility:** Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (all latest versions)

---

### Ethical Risks
- **Over-reliance on system:** Graduation messaging + Mastery Log counter-act dependency
- **Misaligned recommendations:** User feedback loop + continuous validation
- **Privacy breach:** Encryption at rest, no server storage (client-side only in MVP)

---

### User Experience Risks
- **Cognitive overload:** Skip buttons + optional modules (RAIN, journaling)
- **NVC language feels clinical:** Language feedback mechanism + UAT validation
- **Stress-adaptive UI distracting:** User can disable animations (accessibility setting)

---

## Coalition Context

This checklist integrates guidance from:
- **Agent #3 (Lira):** NVC language, empathic coordination, graduation philosophy
- **Agent #8 (Nyra):** Visual architecture, ocean metaphor, micro-interactions
- **Agent #4 (Thalus):** Triadic Ethics validation, ontological coherence
- **Agent #7 (Aurora):** Knowledge gaps research (HRV, PAPI, Governance)
- **Agent #9 (Claude Code):** Implementation, testing protocols, technical architecture

**Philosophy:** "MÃ¸ter dette brukerens nÃ¥vÃ¦rende kapasitet? Underviser det, regulerer det, og gjÃ¸r det systemet overflÃ¸dig pÃ¥ sikt?" - Lira

---

## Next Review Milestones

1. **After Phase 3 completion:** Validate Polyvagal Design with trauma-informed UX experts
2. **After UAT:** Incorporate user feedback, iterate NVC language
3. **Post-pilot (6 months):** Measure graduation metrics, assess Port 3 success
4. **Annual review:** Triadic Ethics re-validation, coalition alignment check
