# Getting Started with Living Compendia

Welcome! This tutorial will help you understand the Homo Lumen Living Compendia system.

## What are Living Compendia?

Living Compendia are **living documents** that evolve with each agent's learning. Unlike static documentation, they:

- **Grow** with new Learning Points (LPs)
- **Adapt** based on emergent insights
- **Connect** across agents via cross-references
- **Validate** using Triadic Ethics framework

## Structure

Each Learning Point (LP) contains:

- **Problem** - What challenge did we face?
- **Solution** - How did we solve it?
- **Why It Matters** - Context and significance
- **Lessons Learned** - Key takeaways
- **Triadic Ethics Validation** - Port 1, 2, 3 scores
- **Connection to Previous Learning** - Cross-references

## Example: LP #037

See **[LP #037: HWF Emotion Wheel Complete](../reference/learning-points/lp-037-hwf-complete.md)** for a complete example.

## Next Steps

1. Read the **[Agent Index](../reference/agent-index.md)** to understand the 10-agent coalition
2. Explore **[Brain-MCP Hybrid Architecture](../explanation/architecture/brain-mcp-hybrid.md)**
3. Learn **[How to Add New Learning Point](../how-to/add-learning-point.md)**
