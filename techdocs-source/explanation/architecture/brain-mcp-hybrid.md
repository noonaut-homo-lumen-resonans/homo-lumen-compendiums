# Brain-MCP Hybrid Architecture

The Brain-MCP Hybrid combines neuroscience-inspired architecture with Anthropic's Model Context Protocol.

## Concept

- **LLM Reasoning** (ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini) = Prefrontal Cortex (strategic thinking)
- **MCP Protocols** (structured tools) = Basal Ganglia (procedural memory, habits)
- **Polyvagal Sensing** (HRV, stress detection) = Autonomic Nervous System
- **Agent Coalition** (distributed cognition) = Multi-Scale Memory (L1-L5)

## Why Hybrid?

Pure LLM: Flexible but unpredictable
Pure MCP: Structured but rigid
**Hybrid:** Best of both worlds

## Implementation

See **[LP #038: MCP/A2A Implementation Guide](../../reference/learning-points/lp-038-mcp-a2a.md)** for full details.
