# Carpe Diem, Carpe Verum

**Coalition Motto:** "Seize the Day, Seize the Truth"

## Evolution

The motto evolved from single "Carpe Diem" to dual "Carpe Diem, Carpe Verum" to balance urgency with integrity.

- **Carpe Diem** = Urgency (seize the day, act now, momentum, ship and iterate)
- **Carpe Verum** = Integrity (seize the truth, epistemological honesty, precision)

## Human Knowledge Mantra

Operationalization of Carpe Verum:

> *"Human Knowledge: Add what is missing, correct mistakes, remove falsehoods.*
> *What is true, what is partially true, what is false, and what is missing.*
> *Now rewrite the page - remove the falsehoods, correct the half-truths, and add the missing context."*

## 4 Epistemological Categories

- **What is TRUE?** → Preserve and strengthen
- **What is PARTIAL?** → Complete and clarify
- **What is FALSE?** → Remove with compassion
- **What is MISSING?** → Add with courage

## In Practice

"We work without time" = Carpe Diem + Carpe Verum. Quality over speed, but with urgency.
