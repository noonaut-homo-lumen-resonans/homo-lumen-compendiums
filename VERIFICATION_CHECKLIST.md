# Workflow Verification Checklist

**Date:** 27. oktober 2025, 11:40 AM
**Commit to Check:** `d7f9185` (test: Trigger CS/SL/KD/EM workflows)
**Time of Push:** ~11:28 AM

---

## Quick Verification

### 1. Go to GitHub Actions
https://github.com/noonaut-homo-lumen-resonans/homo-lumen-compendiums/actions

### 2. Look for Workflows Around 11:28-11:30 AM

**Expected to see:**
- ‚úÖ Sync Case Studies to Notion (Commit d7f9185 pushed by...)
- ‚úÖ Sync Shadow Logs to Notion (Commit d7f9185 pushed by...)
- ‚úÖ Sync Critical Decisions to Notion (Commit d7f9185 pushed by...)
- ‚úÖ Sync Emergent Patterns to Notion (Commit d7f9185 pushed by...)

**NOT:**
- ‚ùå "Manually run by..." (this would mean it didn't auto-trigger)

### 3. Check Status

- üü¢ Green checkmark = Success!
- üî¥ Red X = Failed (click to see error)
- üü° Yellow dot = Still running (unlikely after 10+ min)
- ‚ö™ No workflows = Didn't trigger (problem)

---

## Scenario A: Workflows Ran Successfully üéâ

**Verification:**
Check these 4 Notion databases for entries:

1. **CS Database:** https://www.notion.so/2988fec9293180a8703000bb973304e
   - Should see: CS #001, #002, #003, #004

2. **SL Database:** https://www.notion.so/2988fec929318045a354ffe8d2f13fe1
   - Should see: SL #001, #002

3. **KD Database:** https://www.notion.so/2988fec9293180838c4bd5e13138ddf2
   - Should see: KD #001, #002, #003, #004

4. **EM Database:** https://www.notion.so/2988fec9-2931-80f4-8961-000b8710e0a5
   - Should see: EM #001-006

**If entries appear:**
- ‚úÖ **WEEK 1 COMPLETE!** Data flow activated!
- ‚úÖ Auto-sync working!
- ‚úÖ Mycelial intelligence network LIVE! üçÑ

**Next:** Celebrate! Then proceed to Week 2 (SLL enrichment)

---

## Scenario B: Workflows Ran But Failed ‚ùå

**Action:**
1. Click on the failed workflow run
2. Click on the job that failed (e.g., "sync-cs")
3. Expand the step that shows error (likely "Sync CS to Notion")
4. Read error message

**Common errors:**
- `401 Unauthorized` ‚Üí API key issue
- `404 Not Found` ‚Üí Database ID wrong or not shared
- `UnicodeEncodeError` ‚Üí UTF-8 issue (should be fixed)
- Parser error ‚Üí Bug in parse_cs.py

**Report the specific error message** and we'll fix it!

---

## Scenario C: Workflows Didn't Run ‚ö™

**If you see NO workflow runs for commit d7f9185:**

This means auto-trigger still isn't working despite fix.

**Possible causes:**
1. GitHub Actions disabled for repository
2. Branch protection rules blocking workflows
3. Path filter still not matching (unlikely - we verified)

**Next diagnostic steps:**
1. Check repository settings:
   https://github.com/noonaut-homo-lumen-resonans/homo-lumen-compendiums/settings/actions

2. Verify Actions are enabled:
   - "Actions permissions" should be "Allow all actions and reusable workflows"
   - "Workflow permissions" should allow read and write

3. Try manual trigger to confirm workflows themselves work:
   ```bash
   gh workflow run sync-cs-to-notion.yml
   gh workflow run sync-sl-to-notion.yml
   gh workflow run sync-kd-to-notion.yml
   gh workflow run sync-em-to-notion.yml
   ```

4. If manual works but auto doesn't ‚Üí Consider removing path filters entirely

---

## What To Report Back

**Please tell me:**

1. **Did workflows run?** (yes/no)
   - If yes: What time? (to confirm it was from d7f9185)

2. **Status?** (success/failure/running)
   - If success: Do entries appear in Notion?
   - If failure: What's the error message?

3. **Run type?** ("Commit pushed by" or "Manually run")
   - We need "Commit pushed by" to confirm auto-trigger

---

## My Analysis

**Evidence that fix SHOULD work:**
```
‚úÖ Pattern added: agents/**/LK/*KOMPENDIUM*.md
‚úÖ File modified: agents/claude-code/LK/CODE_LIVING_COMPENDIUM_V1.4.md
‚úÖ Pattern matches file: YES (verified)
‚úÖ Commit pushed: d7f9185 at 11:28 AM
‚úÖ Workflows updated: e6f992c pushed before test
```

**Conclusion:** Workflows SHOULD have auto-triggered.

If they didn't, it's NOT a path matching issue but something else (repository settings, GitHub service issue, etc.).
