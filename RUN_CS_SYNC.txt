# Instructions to Manually Sync CS Entries to Notion

Since GitHub Secrets exist but CS #004 isn't appearing, run this manually:

## Option 1: PowerShell (Recommended for Windows)

Open PowerShell in the homo-lumen-compendiums directory and run:

```powershell
# Set environment variables (get NOTION_API_KEY from GitHub Secrets or Notion integrations)
$env:NOTION_API_KEY = "your-notion-api-key-here"
$env:CS_DATABASE_ID = "2988fec9-2931-803a-8703-000bb973304e"

# Run parser
python scripts/parse_cs.py
```

## Option 2: Use the manual sync script

```powershell
# Set API key first
$env:NOTION_API_KEY = "your-notion-api-key-here"

# Run script
.\manual_sync_cs.ps1
```

## After Running

Check Notion CS Database for these entries:
- CS #001: 4-Database Mycelial Intelligence Implementation
- CS #002: UTF-8 Encoding Fix for Notion Database Discovery
- CS #003: Database ID Discovery via Relations
- CS #004: 17-Database Ecosystem Discovery & Mycelial Architecture Design

## If It Works

If entries appear after running manually, this confirms:
✅ Parser works
✅ GitHub Secrets are configured
❌ GitHub Actions workflow might not be triggering properly

We can then investigate why the workflow isn't running automatically.

## Get Your Notion API Key

1. Go to: https://www.notion.so/my-integrations
2. Find "Homo Lumen MCP Automation"
3. Copy the "Internal Integration Token"
4. Use that as NOTION_API_KEY value
