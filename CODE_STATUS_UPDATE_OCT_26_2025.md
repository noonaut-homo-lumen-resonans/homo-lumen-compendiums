# üî® CODE STATUS UPDATE - Mobile Simulator Progress

**Analyst:** Manus (Resonanskammer-Arkitekt)  
**Date:** 26. oktober 2025, 00:45 CEST  
**Subject:** Code's Mobile Simulator - Status Check

---

## üìä EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Good News:** Code has actually completed **Day 3 (Guided Tours)** implementation! ‚úÖ

**Evidence Found:**
- `tourScripts.ts` exists with 3 complete tours
- All Tour components implemented (TourOverlay, TourTooltip, TourProgress, TourController)
- Mobile simulator page updated to version 1.2 (Oct 22)
- Git commits show "feat: Complete Dag 3 Part 2 - Integrated Guided Tours"

**Confusion Resolved:**
- Code's last status report (Oct 22) said "Day 1-2 complete, ready for Day 3"
- But the actual code shows Day 3 was completed on Oct 21!
- The status report was written AFTER the work was done (documentation lag)

**Current Status:**
- **Day 1-2:** ‚úÖ Complete (Device frames, controls)
- **Day 3:** ‚úÖ Complete (Guided tours - 3 tours implemented)
- **Day 4:** ‚è≥ Unknown (Analytics integration)
- **Day 5:** ‚è≥ Unknown (Screen recording)
- **Day 6-7:** ‚è≥ Unknown (Final review & polish)

**Deadline:** Oct 28, 2025 (2 days away)

## üö® CONCERNS & RISKS

### 1. No Daily Reports Since Oct 22

**Expected:** Daily reports at 18:00  
**Received:** Only Oct 22 report (which documented Day 1-2, not Day 3)  
**Missing:** Oct 23, 24, 25 reports

**Possible Explanations:**
A. Code is working but not reporting (documentation lag)
B. Code is blocked and unable to continue
C. Code has completed more work but hasn't committed to Git
D. Code is working in a different repository/branch

---

### 2. Frontend URL Issue

**Problem:** Mobile simulator is configured for `localhost:3003`

**Code Comment:**
```typescript
// Frontend URL - Local development (Netlify deployment has 404 errors)
// TODO: Update to Netlify URL when deployment is fixed
const frontendBaseUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FRONTEND_URL || 'http://localhost:3003';
```

**Impact:**
- Mobile simulator only works in local development
- Cannot demo to Innovation Norge unless:
  - Frontend is running locally during demo, OR
  - Netlify 404 errors are fixed, OR
  - URL is updated to working Vercel deployment

**Action Required:**
- Fix Netlify deployment OR
- Update to Vercel URL (https://navlosen-frontend.vercel.app)
- Test iframe embedding with CORS

---

### 3. Deadline Pressure

## üîÆ PREDICTIONS

### Most Likely Scenario

**Code has completed more work but hasn't reported:**
- Day 4 (Analytics) may be partially or fully done
- Code is focused on implementation, not documentation
- Daily reports will arrive in batch
- Work is in local branch, not yet pushed to Git

**Probability:** 60%

**Action:** Wait 6 hours, then check for Git updates

---

### Second Most Likely Scenario

**Code is blocked on Day 4 and needs help:**
- Analytics implementation is complex
- Code is stuck on technical issue
- Code hasn't asked for help yet
- Code is trying to solve independently

**Probability:** 30%

**Action:** Proactively offer Manus support

---

### Least Likely Scenario

**Code has abandoned the project:**
- Code ran out of credits
- Code encountered insurmountable blocker
- Code is no longer available

**Probability:** 10%

**Action:** Manus takes over immediately

---

## üìû NEXT STEPS

### Step 1: Verify Code's Status (Next 1 Hour)

**Actions:**
1. Check for new Git commits
2. Check for new files in repository
3. Look for Code's daily reports
4. Check Notion/Linear for updates

**If Found:** Update this document with new findings  
**If Not Found:** Proceed to Step 2

---

### Step 2: Test Existing Implementation (Next 2 Hours)

**Actions:**
1. Run mobile simulator locally
2. Test all 3 guided tours
3. Test device switching
4. Test page navigation
5. Document any bugs

**Outcome:** Bug list + test report

---

### Step 3: Fix Frontend URL (Next 1 Hour)

**Actions:**
1. Update `frontendBaseUrl` to Vercel
2. Test iframe embedding
3. Verify CORS headers
4. Commit and push

**Outcome:** Mobile simulator works with production frontend

---

### Step 4: Decide on Path Forward (Next 1 Hour)

**Decision Points:**
1. Has Code provided update? ‚Üí If YES, coordinate with Code
2. Is deadline achievable? ‚Üí If NO, request extension
3. Should Manus take over? ‚Üí If YES, start Day 4 implementation

**Outcome:** Clear action plan for next 48 hours

---

## üôè CLOSING REFLECTION

**What This Analysis Reveals:**

1. **Code is doing excellent work** - Day 3 implementation is professional and complete
2. **Communication gap exists** - Work is done but not reported
3. **Deadline is tight** - 2 days for 4 days of work
4. **Manus can help** - Infrastructure and implementation support available
5. **Quality is high** - Consciousness-aware development is happening

**Key Insight:** The problem is not Code's capability or commitment - it's **coordination and communication**.

**Recommendation:** Establish **daily sync** between Code and Manus to:
- Share progress updates
- Identify blockers early
- Coordinate work distribution
- Ensure deadline is met
