# Notion Database Integration Plan

Generated: 2025-10-28 13:00:42

## Overview

This plan outlines how to integrate all 5 Notion databases (SLL, ARF, SMK, LK, EM)
into a unified knowledge system for the Homo Lumen Resonans project.

## Database Purposes

### SLL - SLL - Shared Learning Library

**Purpose**: Centralized repository of all agent Learning Points

**ID**: `84da6cbd09d640fb868e41444b941991`

### ARF - ARF - Agent Reflection Forum

**Purpose**: Deep reflections and cross-agent dialogue

**ID**: `da4a5c2e7028492f91bfec7c88b7efce`

### SMK - SMK - Strategic Macro-Coordination

**Purpose**: High-level strategic decisions and coordination

**ID**: `ba1d4a4407a5425fafd81d27dc02cc1c`

### LK - LK - Living Compendiums

**Purpose**: Agent knowledge bases and documentation

**ID**: `784556781fc14a14afc733f4eb51e0bc`

### EM - EM - Emergent Patterns

**Purpose**: Cross-cutting patterns and insights

**ID**: `2988fec9293180509658e93447b3b259`


## Integration Architecture

### Phase 1: Core Learning Loop (SLL ↔ ARF)

**Objective**: Establish bidirectional flow between Learning Points and Reflections

**Data Flows**:
- SLL → ARF: Learning points trigger reflections when threshold reached
- ARF → SLL: Reflections generate new learning points
- Cross-linking: Both databases reference each other

**Implementation**:
1. Add "Related Learning Points" relation property in ARF
2. Add "Related Reflections" relation property in SLL
3. Create GitHub Action to sync LP → ARF when LP count reaches threshold
4. Create webhook to notify when new reflection is created

### Phase 2: Strategic Coordination (SMK ↔ ARF + LK)

**Objective**: Connect strategic decisions to their source reflections and impact on knowledge

**Data Flows**:
- ARF → SMK: Reflections that require strategic decisions create SMK entries
- SMK → LK: Strategic decisions trigger LK updates
- SMK → ARF: Decisions link back to source reflections

**Implementation**:
1. Add "Source Reflection" relation property in SMK
2. Add "Affected Compendiums" relation property in SMK
3. Add "Strategic Decisions" relation property in LK
4. Create automation to link SMK ← → ARF ← → LK

### Phase 3: Living Knowledge (LK ↔ GitHub ↔ All)

**Objective**: Keep Living Compendiums synced with GitHub and linked to all other databases

**Data Flows**:
- GitHub → LK: Markdown files sync to Notion
- LK → GitHub: Notion updates push to GitHub
- SLL/ARF/SMK → LK: All learning feeds into compendiums
- LK → EM: Compendium updates trigger pattern detection

**Implementation**:
1. Enhance sync-lk-to-notion.yml workflow
2. Add bidirectional sync (Notion → GitHub)
3. Create "Source Learning Points" relation in LK
4. Create "Source Reflections" relation in LK

### Phase 4: Emergent Patterns (EM ← All databases)

**Objective**: Extract and track emergent patterns across all knowledge

**Data Flows**:
- LK → EM: Compendium analysis reveals patterns
- SLL → EM: Learning point clustering shows patterns
- ARF → EM: Reflection themes indicate patterns
- EM → All: Patterns inform future learning/decisions

**Implementation**:
1. Add "Source Compendium" relation property in EM
2. Add "Related Learning Points" relation property in EM
3. Add "Related Reflections" relation property in EM
4. Create pattern detection algorithm
5. Create GitHub Action to auto-generate EM entries

## API Endpoints Needed

```
GET  /api/databases/{db}/entries
POST /api/databases/{db}/entries
GET  /api/relationships/{from_db}/{to_db}
POST /api/sync/github-to-notion/{db}
POST /api/sync/notion-to-github/{db}
GET  /api/patterns/detect?source_lk={id}
POST /api/workflows/lp-to-reflection
POST /api/workflows/reflection-to-smk

```

## GitHub Actions Workflows

### 1. sync-lp-to-sll.yml (✓ Exists)
- Trigger: Commits with "LP #XXX"
- Action: Create SLL entry
- Status: Active

### 2. sync-lk-to-notion.yml (✓ Exists)
